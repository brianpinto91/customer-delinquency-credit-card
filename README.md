# customer-delinquency-credit-card

This is a credit-risk modeling project that aims to predict worsening delinquencies on credit-card accounts using ML. This is useful for risk management teams to identify accounts heading toward charge-off. The dataset has 2 million records of unique clients, of which only 10% are delinquent. A model with high recall score is desired so that we identify most of the delinquent customers to reduce the risk and potential loss to the credit lending agency. At the same time a good precision score is also desidered so that cost of false flags are minimized which directly impacts the revenue from potential customers.

The detailed analyis is in the notebook [modelling_1.ipynb](modelling_1.ipynb)
